# Project 3 - *Parsegram*

**Parsegram** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view
- [ ] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show an indeterminate progress bar while the post is being uploaded to Parse.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Loading bar for sign up and login page while Parse is creating/authenticating
- [x] Floating action button to bring user to the create post section
- [ ] ** Need to implement swipe to refresh on recyclerview, or manually push newest created post to recycler view **

## Notes

- Attempted to implement features before watching the videos; Used what I remembered from previous videos to build out functionality (which is why I spent so many hours on this project)
